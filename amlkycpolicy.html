                <p >Money Laundering/Combating financing terrorism (AML/KYC/CFT) is the 
                    process of concealing financial transactions to make illegitimate money, 
                    derived from illegal activities such as embezzlement/corruption/illegal 
                    gambling/terrorism/organized crime, appear legitimate. Under a broad 
                    definition, the laundering process is accomplished in three stages:</p>
<p>(b) Layering – separating the illicit proceeds from their source by creating 
    complex layers of financial transactions designed to disguise the audit trail and 
    provide anonymity.
</p>
<p>(c) Integration – the provision of apparent legitimacy to wealth derived from
    crime.
    </p>
<p>If the layering process is successful, integration schemes place the laundered 
    proceeds back into the economy in such a way that they re-enter the financial 
    system appearing as normal business funds. Its main objective is to hide the 
    real source of illegal proceeds and make them legally usable, by converting 
    them into legitimate money through a series of financial transactions. 
    Technological advancements have helped money launderers adopt innovative 
    means to transfer funds faster across continents making detection and 
    preventive action more difficult. The attempted misuse of the financial system 
    for the perpetration of fraud has been recognized globally as a major problem 
    that needs to be continuously tackled at every level in a dynamic manner. As a 
    Responsible Company, we consider it our moral, social, and economic.

measures to ascertain the purpose of the transaction, the origin, and ultimate
destination of the funds involved and the identity and address, of any ultimate 
beneficiary.</p>

            <p>The Company maintains an onboarding and ongoing employee-training 
                program to ensure that relevant staff is adequately trained in KYC procedures. 
                The timing and content of training vary based on the target audience. Training 
                requirements should have a different focus for new staff, staff dealing with new 
                customers or customer retention. The new staff is educated about the basics of 
                AML / CFT and KYC procedures and the importance of implementation of all 
                relevant compliance policies. These basic compliance requirements are 
                presented to them during the two-week onboarding training that every new 
                staff member must attend. Staff members who deal directly with the customers 
                are trained to verify the identity of new customers, exercise due diligence in 
                handling accounts of existing customers on an ongoing basis and detect 
                patterns of suspicious activity. Regular refresher training is provided to ensure 
                that employees are reminded of their responsibilities and are kept informed of 
                new developments. It is crucial that all relevant staff fully understand the need
